                    <a className='bio-content'>Hi there! I'm a full-stack developer with a background in classical music and non-profit fundraising. Originally from western Massachusetts, I lived in New York City for a number of years and recently relocated to Durham, North Carolina. In addition to pursuing my work as a software developer, I continue to freelance as a classical composer specializing in concert music. At its core, composing is creative problem solvingâ€”not unlike coding. My musical training has meaningfully supported my development as a software engineer.

                    <br></br>
                    I received a bachelor's degree from the Shepherd School of Music at Rice University, master's degrees from The Juilliard School and Yale University, and I'm currently completing a coding certificate at Columbia University's School of Engineering.</a>
