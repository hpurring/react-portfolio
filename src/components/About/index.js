            <a>Hi there! I'm a new coder with a background in classical music and non-profit fundraising. A gifted writer and communicator, I'm studying coding and software development to expand my ability to meaningfully and creatively interact with the arts and arts-adjacent industries. Originally from western Massachusetts, I lived in New York City for a number of years and recently relocated to Durham, North Carolina. I continue to freelance as a classical composer specializing in concert music, and upcoming projects include new orchestral, chamber, and vocal works. Learn more about my compositional pursuits here. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I received a bachelor's degree from the Shepherd School of Music at Rice University, master's degrees from The Juilliard School and Yale University, and I'm currently completing a coding certificate at Columbia University's School of Engineering.</a>
